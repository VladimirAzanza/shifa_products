# Shifa Products

This is a work in progress of Shifa Products marketplace using Python-Django as backend with Bootstrapp Frontend.

Shifa Products is an Freelance project designed to sell medicinal products, Customers are allowed to:
  - Leave reviews and rate products
  - Add addresses
  - View order status
  - Review order history
  - Edit their profile
  - Manage passwords

To write this project, I needed to understand concepts such as: MVT architecture, backend development, url routing, Object-Relation Mapping(Django ORM), static files management, Django templates.

## Logging Configuration

In Shifa Products, a logging system has been set up to track important events, errors, and activities within the project. This is configured in settings.py. Hereâ€™s how the logging system works and how you can access the logs:

The logging system is configured using a dictionary called LOGGING. 

- Handlers: Defines where the log messages should go. In this case, there are two handlers:

  - File Handler: Logs messages to a file (shifa_products/logs/debug.log).
  - Console Handler: Logs messages to the console.

- Formatters: Specifies how the log messages should be formatted.
- Loggers: Configures the loggers for specific parts of the project:

  - django: Logs Django-related events to a file.
  - telegram_notifications: Logs related to order telegram notifications.
